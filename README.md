# Golang Data Structures and Algoriths

## Data structures in Golang
* [LinkedList](https://github.com/AntonyIS/Golang-DSA/LinkedList) in Go has the following basic operations that can be performed.
    * Add 
    * Append
    * Prepend
    * Insert
    * Search 
    * Remove item at index
    * Remove item 
    * Check if empty
    * Size


I am basically learning DSA in Python and translate the same solutions into Golang;
